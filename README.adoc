= NMEA2000_esp32-c6 esp-idf library for ESP32 boards =

Inherited object for use NMEA2000 library for ESP32 Boards.
See also https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000[NMEA2000] library.

To use this library, you will also need [my fork of the NMEA2000 library](https://github.com/gpearcey/NMEA2000).

This library uses the esp32 twai driver for TWAI0. No driver has yet been implemented by espressif for TWAI1.
